# resume
This repository follows the structure of my resume for ML related jobs. 

Many projects uploaded here are team course projects and have contributions from other people. It would require unreasonable amount of work to pick out my own contributions, if that's even possible. Team projects naturally involve more or less scripts which are a mixture of people's work.

My personal contributions are listed in the resume.
