Music Editor
It is a program that allows your write your own Music on Matlab and Play it몴

1.	Install
(1.1)
I have provided a app package that allows you install it on the matlab and find it in MY APPS
 
And run it like a real program other than a m.file몴.

(1.2)
If you wish, you can also run the Music_Editor_shen1_1386326.m
DO NOT DIRECTELY DOUBLE CLINK 몷 .fig몸 FILE TO RUN IT.
IT WILL NEVER WORK
2.	Background knowledge몴
Well몴If you want to write a music, you have to know how to write a note..
Matlab does not provide a function that allows me to show the melody like this..
 
So you have to write them in characters몴

According to Wiki몴
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Note
And my simply modified.

You can find the note provided in the following table

If you want to create a period of blank, in other word, pause for a few second.
Use blq to replace 1/4 note
Use ble to replace 1/8 note
Use bls to replace 1/16 note
Example
 
This melody only plays a 1/8 note do in 3th octave 
But before you hear that , it pauses for the time of 2 1/8 note.
3.	Grammar
If you are creating a new melody.
Start writing at the very beginning of the script.
Add a single space between every notes.eg:
 
If you are combining an ensemble
Just place the notes you write on the same vertical line.no more no less
Example
 
NOTE: in this situation there will be a space at the very beginning of each line
NOTE: NEVER ENTER A SAPCE AT THE END OF LINE, AND NEVER LEAVE A BLANK WHEN THERE SHOULD BE A NOTE
Error presentation:
(1)	Leave a blank
 
(2)	Not in vertical line
 

4.	I have provided a sample melody (Ode_to_joy.m)  created by this program
So if you don몶t know how to test, this might help.
To listen this melody
1)	Run the program
2)	Enter the name in the edit text above the 몷play몸 button
